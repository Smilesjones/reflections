1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would use a remote repository if I am going to be working with other people on 
a project, if I usually use multiple computers (like a work computer and a home
computer), or if I want others to access my work, such as an open source project
or as part of a portfolio.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?



3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?


4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?


5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?


6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
